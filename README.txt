Replacement Selection Strategy
------------------------------

Usage: java MakeRuns <Heap size> <Input file> <Output file>

Heap size is the size of the heap to use when generating runs

Input file is the name of the input file to use. Use - for stdin

Output file is the name of the Output file to use. Use - for stdout

All output lines will be prepended wit a - character to indicate a line of text
Runs will be delimited by an empty line

PolyPhase Merge Sort
--------------------

Usage: java PolyMerge <Number of temp files> <Number of runs> <Input file>

Number of temp files is the number of temporary files to use while doing the Polyphase Sort Merge

Number of runs is the number of runs in the input file generated by the MakeRuns command. This can be set to -1 if this should be calculated internally by doing an initial pass over the input file.

Input file is the file generated by MakeRuns to use as the initial input for the Polyphase Sort Merge

Writes sorted output to stdout and writes the number of polyphase iterations required to stderr.
